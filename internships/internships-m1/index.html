        <h2>Internship M1</h2>
        <h5></h5>
        

    </div>

    <div align="start" class="content"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>During your <strong>1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->st<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> year you have to do 2 groups of activities
beyond classes (called “soft skills”): <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ol>
<li>TER (<em>Travail d&rsquo;Etude et de Recherche</em>) =  <strong>Research training</strong>
(Personal work supervised by a member of the master&rsquo;s teaching team)</li>
<li><strong>Internship OR Seminar</strong> (<em>école thématique</em>)
OR participation in a challenge or Hackathon (5 ECTS)</li>
</ol>
<p>Although they are marked as belonging to different semesters,
they can both be done whenever you like as long as they are completed
at the end of June.
Most students accomplish their TER during the 3<!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
and 4<!-- raw HTML omitted -->th<!-- raw HTML omitted --> trimester (January to April) and their internship
in May and June.</p>
<h3 id="ter-research-training">TER (research training)</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 day for 2 to 4 months</li>
<li>Graded by the TER supervisor</li>
<li>5 ECTS</li>
</ul>
<p>During the 2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->nd<!-- raw HTML omitted --> trimester (November to December)
we will share research subjects proposed by the researchers of our labs,
to be completed during the 3<!-- raw HTML omitted -->rd<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or 4<!-- raw HTML omitted -->th<!-- raw HTML omitted --> trimester.
Some subjects can be taken by a group of students.
This work can take the form of a review of the state of the art
on a given scientific subject and/or the implementation
of state of the art algorithms for the application on a given problem.
You can also find a “research training” yourself.
If it is outside of our labs, please check with us first.</p>
<p>It is expected that you spend half a day to a day per week in the lab
for 2 to 4 months (equivalent to a whole week of work full-time).
The work is not remunerated.
You hand in an (individual) report of your work of about 6 pages
to the researchers that are supervising your work.
They will give you a grade for your work.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need for any internship contract to be signed,
unless it is taking place outside of Université Paris-Saclay.</p>
<h3 id="internship--seminar">Internship – Seminar</h3>
<h4 id="m1-internship">M1 Internship</h4>
<ul>
<li>At least 1 month full time (or equivalent)</li>
<li>No grade: PASS/NO PASS</li>
<li>5 ECTS</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to do an internship, you have to find a public research
laboratory inside or outside of Paris-Saclay
or a private company doing research in our field of AI and data science.
We will also share with you some proposals.
Your internship has to last at least 1 month, full-time work,
or the equivalent in part-time work spread out over several months.
If your internship lasts up to 2 months it may or may not be
financially compensated, if it lasts longer, you must receive, by law,
at least a small gratification, see
<a href="https://www.service-public.fr/professionnels-entreprises/vosdroits/F32131">service-public.fr</a>
(about 500€ per month).</p>
<p>You need to contact us before you start your internship so we approve of it
and quite a few papers have to be signed. If you start before the signatures,
you are not insured and the time already spent cannot be taken into account.
You will not get a grade but you will need a proof signed by the person
in the lab that is in charge of you,
saying that you completed the internship successfully.
You will have to hand us in an (individual) report of your work
of about 4 pages.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We can also validate an internship you completed during the summer 2020.</p>
<h4 id="ecole-thématique-seminar-or-hackathon-or-challenge">Ecole thématique (Seminar) or hackathon (or challenge)</h4>
<ul>
<li>At least 3 days full time of classes</li>
<li>No grade: PASS/NO PASS</li>
<li>5 ECTS</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose to replace the internship with a “summer” school
(that can take place any time of the year,
except in summer as it has to be completed before the end of June),
or a Hackathon/challenge.
You may contact us to validate a summer school you took in the summer 2020.
We will make some proposals for schools, series or seminars, hackathons,
or challenges you can participate in, some of which are competitive to enter.
Check with us if you want to choose one that has not been proposed by us.
At the end, we expect you to send a short report (2 pages maximum)
with links to the classes you followed and the projects you finished to us.
Instead of a summer school, it is also possible to select seminars <em>à la carte</em>.
You have to attend at least 6 seminars in our field (online or classroom)
and write a paragraph for each seminar of what you learned in your own words,
insisting on what it specifically brings to your fields of interest.</p>
<p>For hackathons of challenges, you have to prove that you entered by showing
your entries the challenge leaderboard and submit a short 2-page report,
including the URL of the challenge and the URL of your Github repository.</p>
