We will also share with you some proposals. Your internship has to last at least 5 months of full-time work. It must be financially compensated, by law, see service-public.</description></item><item><title>Master 1</title><link>https://upsay-master-cs-ai.github.io/internships/internships-m1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://upsay-master-cs-ai.github.io/internships/internships-m1/</guid><description>Master 1 – Scientific Exploration # During your 1st year you have to do 2 groups of activities beyond classes (called “soft skills”): TER (travail d&amp;rsquo;étude et de recherche) = Research training (Personal work supervised by a member of the master&amp;rsquo;s teaching team) Internship (or Seminar/School — école thématique — or participation in a challenge or Hackathon for 5 ECTS) Although they are marked as belonging to different semesters, they can both be done whenever you like as long as they are completed by the end of June.</description></item></channel></rss>
