Most students accomplish their TER during the 3rd and 4th trimester (January to April) and their internship in May and June.\nTER (Research Training) #   1 day for 2 to 4 months Graded by the TER supervisor 5 ECTS  During the 2nd trimester (November to December) we will share research subjects proposed by the researchers of our labs, to be completed during the 3rd or 4th trimester. Some subjects can be taken by a group of students. This work can take the form of a review of the state of the art on a given scientific subject and/or the implementation of state of the art algorithms for the application on a given problem. You can also find a “research training” yourself. If it is outside of our labs, please check with us first.\nIt is expected that you spend half a day to a day per week in the lab for 2 to 4 months (equivalent to a whole week of full-time work). The work is not financially compensated. You hand in an (individual) report of your work of about 6 pages to the researchers that are supervising your work. They will then give you a grade.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no need for any internship contract to be signed, unless it is taking place outside of Université Paris-Saclay.\nInternship or Seminar/Schools #  M1 Internship #   At least 1 month full time (or equivalent) No grade: PASS/NO PASS 5 ECTS  If you choose to do an internship, you have to find a public research laboratory inside or outside of Paris-Saclay or a private company doing research in our field of AI and data science. We will also share with you some proposals. Your internship has to last at least 1 month, full-time work, or the equivalent in part-time work spread out over several months. If your internship lasts up to 2 months it may or may not be financially compensated, if it lasts longer, you must receive, by law, at least a small gratification, see service-public.fr (about 500€ per month).\nYou need to contact us before you start your internship so we approve of it and quite a few papers have to be signed. If you start before the signatures, you are not insured and the time already spent cannot be taken into account. You will not get a grade but you will need a proof signed by the person in the lab that is in charge of you, saying that you completed the internship successfully. You will have to hand us in an (individual) report of your work of about 4 pages.\nWe can also validate an internship you completed during the summer 2020.\nSeminar/Schools or Hackathon/Challenge #   At least 3 days full-time classes No grade: PASS/NO PASS 5 ECTS  You can choose to replace the internship with a “summer” school (that can take place any time of the year, except in summer as it has to be completed before the end of June), or a Hackathon/challenge. You may contact us to validate a summer school you took in the summer 2020. We will make some proposals for schools, series or seminars, hackathons, or challenges you can participate in, some of which are competitive to enter. Check with us if you want to choose one that has not been proposed by us. At the end, we expect you to send a short report (2 pages maximum) with links to the classes you followed and the projects you finished to us. Instead of a summer school, it is also possible to select seminars à la carte. You have to attend at least 6 seminars in our field (online or classroom) and write a paragraph for each seminar of what you learned in your own words, insisting on what it specifically brings to your fields of interest.\nFor hackathons of challenges, you have to prove your active participation by showing your entries the challenge leaderboard and by submitting a short 2-page report, including the URL of the challenge and of your Github repository.\n"});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/internships/internships-m2/','title':"Internship M2",'section':"Internships",'content':"M2 – Internships #  Introduction #  For your internship, you have to find a public research laboratory inside or outside of Paris-Saclay or a private company doing research in our field of AI and data science.
